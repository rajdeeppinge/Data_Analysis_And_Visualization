D 3 vidoes a factor?

is video itself a factor? i think no

Xijk - each observer (from 26)

//////////////

TA advice- video may affect results. So do 2-way anova sep for a given video seqeuence.

         - another way, do pair wise 2-way anova pariwise between the 3 factors???? (dunno)
		 
D what is the procedure of 2-way? How to accept reject?

////////////////////////////

MATLAB anova2 proc- 

replication - observas for a pair of factors.


//// anova running is done

To do- 1. do exploratory analysis [use diagrams sugg by Sir]and check for the samples given what kind of effect do the factors have? 
FOR THE SAMPLE are they
significant[can you observe a difference]. 
2.If yes then the question would be are they statistically significant. 


///////// exploratory analysis

one thing to do will be to sum over a factor, this asumes that factor will not have any effect. STRONG ASSUMPTION
Hence sir says that group by group compara is better than the former. 

e.g sumover indica that capsule is not significant but group wise it indicates that there may be an effect.
from juice G to D in cap C it is inc but for V it is dec and hence the summing does not show much difference. Not 
very proper.

For the case of juice means, for C large difference, but for V not much differece. This suggests interaction between
juice and capsule.

///////////

Get such values and the diagram.

check capsule efect disregarding diff in juice: implies take average across the diges juives[same as avg of avg of for juices]

/////////

first get summed up averages. 

then get group averages. [ 3 x 8 = 24 groups]. then think of interac diagrams.

////////////

the 24 MOS are the 2 factor group means.

added MOS to vid1_data.

observations- for a bit rate, not much variation across upscalers, not much effect of upscalers. 
			  diff between X_b_str [averaging across upscalers.]
	
// group average table contains all the 24 group averages.
